## 🕶️ Why Ray-Ban Meta Glasses?
Imagine having a helpful companion who sees exactly what you see, hears what you hear, and can gently remind you of things you might have forgotten—all without you having to pull out a phone or ask for help.

That's what Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses do for our users. They blend into everyday life like a regular pair of sunglasses, but they're quietly capturing moments and ready to whisper helpful reminders directly into the wearer's ear. No awkward interactions. No shame. Just seamless support.

## 🥽 Why Meta Quest 3?
At night, the Quest headset transforms those captured moments into an immersive "Memory Palace." Instead of passively watching a highlight reel, the wearer is *inside* their memories—walking through the park they visited, seeing the face of the grandchild who stopped by.

This deep sense of presence isn't just for entertainment. Research shows that immersive environments help the brain consolidate memories more effectively. We use this to turn a simple review session into gentle cognitive therapy.

## 😔 The Problem We're Solving

For someone with dementia, every day can feel like walking through fog:
*   **"What was I just doing?"** — Forgetting intentions within minutes leads to unfinished tasks and frustration.
*   **"Who is this person talking to me?"** — Not recognizing a family member causes deep shame and social withdrawal.
*   **"Did I take my medication?"** — Constant uncertainty creates anxiety and repetitive checking.
*   **"How do I get home?"** — Wandering away from safe areas puts lives at risk and exhausts caregivers.

For caregivers, the burden is immense: constant supervision, sleepless nights, and the emotional weight of watching a loved one struggle.

## 💡 Our Solution: OurLife

We built a "memory scaffold" — a system that works quietly in the background to:
1.  **Capture & Encode**: Automatically turn the day's moments into simple, meaningful "memory cards."
2.  **Recall & Guide**: When the user is confused, provide gentle, step-by-step help to get back on track.
3.  **Protect & Escalate**: Detect risky situations (like leaving the house unexpectedly) and alert caregivers with context—not just an alarm.

## ✨ Core Features (What It Actually Does)

### 🕒 "What did I just do?" — The 10-Minute Rewind
When someone feels lost, they can ask: "What was I doing?" The system plays back a short summary of the last few minutes—like a friendly recap from a supportive friend.

### 👥 "Who is this?" — Invisible Social Support
If the glasses detect the wearer looking at someone for a few seconds without speaking, a quiet voice whispers: "That's your daughter, Anna. She visited last Tuesday." No one else hears it. Dignity preserved.

### 📍 "Where are my keys?" — Finding Lost Items
Caregivers can "tag" important spots in the home (like where keys go). When something goes missing, the system can show where it was last seen—with a photo and timestamp. No blame, just help.

### 🛡️ Safety Watch — Gentle Escalation
If the wearer starts heading outside unexpectedly, the glasses ask: "Are you heading out? Do you have your keys and phone?" If they leave a safe zone, the caregiver gets a notification with the location and context—not just an alarm.

## 📱 The Caregiver App

Caregivers aren't just watching passively—they're setting up the system to work best for their loved one:
*   **3D Home Map**: Mark specific spots in the house with custom reminders (e.g., "Kitchen: Remember to turn off the stove").
*   **People Profiles**: Upload photos and details of family and friends so the glasses know who's who.
*   **Scheduled Reminders**: Set time-based nudges ("It's 2 PM, time for your medication").
*   **Location Boundaries**: Define safe zones and get alerts if they're crossed.

## 🥽 The Nightly "Memory Palace" (Meta Quest)

Before bed, the wearer puts on the Quest headset for a 10-15 minute "Memory Palace" session:
*   **Immersive Replay**: Relive the day's highlights in VR—not as a video, but as a place they can look around in.
*   **Gentle Q&A**: The system asks simple questions ("Who visited today?") with visual hints to strengthen recall.
*   **Family Connection**: Remote family members can join the same virtual space to watch the highlights together—even from across the country.

This isn't just entertainment. It's cognitive therapy wrapped in a comfortable, social experience.
